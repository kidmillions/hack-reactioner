# Hack Reactioner #
## Realtime feedback monitor for Sprint Reflection Sessions ##


## Who it's For ##
  Right now, the market is for Hack Reactor to receive instant feedback on polling questions to students during sprint reflections. In a larger sense, however, the tool will serve as a method of polling questions instantly.

## Summary ##
 An instant-polling UI for session moderators / lecturers to hear from students within seconds. A 'thumbs check' for the data-hungry.


## Problem ##
  There are times when a show of thumbs doesn't do the trick. At Hack Reactor, our bi-daily sprint reflections force us to first list topics, then step away from the discussion and individually fill out a google form, only to return back to discussions to reflect on how students voted. A total waste of flow.

 Alternatively, lecturers at HR use a 'thumbs-check' method, where all students are asked to gauge their thumbs based on prompt. While this is a quick and dirty way to poll a crowd, it can be difficult to parse good data with which to work.

## Solution ##
   Time would be better spent if the sprint moderator could instantly poll a question to students, and within seconds receive feedback on that topic. Luckily for us, HR students don't need fancy tricorder buzzer things; we all have laptops that can websocket into an instant polling interface.

   An administrator can float one question to a crowd. The crowd will vote on that topic. We will see a graph populate based on that topic. The admin can then reset the graph and ask a new question.
